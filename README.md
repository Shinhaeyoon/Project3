# Project3
Data was sourced from Kaggle for Airbnb prices in 10 European cities, including Amsterdam, Athens, Barcelona, Berlin, Budapest, Lisbon, London, Paris, Rome, and Vienna. The sample included 50,000 Airbnb locations. The goal of the project was to assist users in finding Airbnb rentals based on price and specific characteristics, such as guest satisfaction ratings.

To achieve this goal, an interactive map was created using Plotly and Leaflet, and a database was established to store the weekday and weekend data sets. The data was then converted to a JSON format and processed using JavaScript and Chart.js. Bins were added to the data to aggregate it by guest ratings and prices.

The user was given filter options to narrow down their search based on guest ratings and prices. The resulting display showed Airbnb properties based on the user's filter selections.
